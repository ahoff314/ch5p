1) Receive two integers as input (firstNum must be less than secondNum).

2) Increment i to equal firstNum, until it is less than or equal to secondNum using.

3) Using while loop, output all odd integers between firstNum and SecondNum using the following formula:

        (firstNum % 2 != 0)

4 ) Using while loop, output the sum of all even integers between firstNum and SecondNum using the
following formula:

        sum += (firstNum % 2 == 0)

5) Using while loop, output squares of values 1 to 10

6) Using while loop, output sum of the squares of odd integers using the following formula:

        squareSum += (firstNum % 2 != 0)

7) Using while loop, output all upper case letters using ASCII
